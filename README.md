react-redux-app-container
=========================

## Prerequisites

react-redux-app-container is expected to be used with create-react-app,
the documentation will only explain it this way.

Make sure you have `create-react-app` installed.
```
npm install -g create-react-app
```
And create a react app with
```
create-react-app hello-world
```

You can also use the forked version of create-react-app with the library
already configured.
(Configured but **not** installed ! You still have to follow the
installation steps)
```
create-react-app hello-world --scripts-version tcra
```

You can now follow the installation steps.

## Installation

```
npm install --save react-redux react-router@^2.8.1 react-router-redux redux redux-thunk react-redux-app-container
```

**Optional**, the devtools:
```
npm install --save-dev redux-devtools redux-devtools-dock-monitor redux-devtools-log-monitor react-redux-app-container-devtools
```

## Configuration
